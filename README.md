Agro Boosting Initiative
Here in India we are farming since decades and centuries, agriculture is the main occupation of 70% of the people who are the real gems of our country.
We in our initiative are making an honest effort to help these gems to shine bright
People living in the cities produce 80% more organic waste than the rural areas. Hence we as care takers and well wishers of the nation have planned a simple and very effect idea for Sustainable farming through the cities!!!
We have planned to attach a vent to the kitchen windows of the buildings which will be attached to the Pit underground which is of large storage capacity.
The waste from the homes will be collected and will be decomposed in the pit with the help of JEEVAMRUTH which will reduce the decomposition time to just one month!!!
This waste will then be transported to the farmers needing manuare 
This method will produce tons of Pure Organic Fertilizer which will be of equivalent strength like the chemical fertilizers; but it will not be harmfull and will protect our mother earth from degradation and will also encourage farmers to cultivate crops of their own chioce
This will benifit our nation the field of agriculture
This process wont be giving us shortb term satisfaction but will give the best returns in the long run
A temperature sensor is attached in the pit which will detect the temperature of the decomposed manure ensuring that the manuare is ready to dispatched
If the government is funding this project it wont put a burden on the city fellows 
The website "kheti_badhoo.com" will help the farmers to post their requirment and will help the city people to transport the manuare to the right farmer
This is all about our project .
jai jawan!! jai kisaan!!
